## ðŸš€ Overview

**PromptOptimizer** is a modular, domain-agnostic system designed to automatically generate and select better prompts for downstream tasks like question answering, summarization, code generation, and more.

It combines:
- A **Prompt Rewriter** (e.g., T5/BART) to generate improved or task-specific prompts.
- A **Prompt Reranker** (e.g., BERT or Bi-Encoder) to score and select the best prompt variant based on context and task.

Ideal for:
- Research agents and RAG systems
- Reducing LLM latency by optimizing prompt efficiency
- Improving output relevance, style, or accuracy
